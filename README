This is not a real project.  It's basically just a sample to practice setting up google app engine. 

I wanted to post code so that I could ask people questions about it.
So please, if you've got better solutions, or think my code sucks, let me know!

My goal here is basically to figure out the best way to setup a default GAE project with ajax tools.

I want to isolate functionality into quarantined sections - I don't want raw XHRs or database connections and queries scattered all over the place.

I was actually very surprised to find that GAE did not already have clean real-time connectivity solutions available as an API, or at least as endorsed recommended plugins.

I mean, I know that I've been spoiled by jQuery and other nice web 2.0 libraries, and I expect everything to work right out of the box; and I know that app engine is free, and who am I to complain, but I mean, it is called App engine, and it is almost 2010, and this is Google we're talking about...

Basically, I was naive to think this was a 'solved problem' that someone like me with little experience shouldn't have to hack on anymore...  I looked around for a long time to figure out the best setup...  when I didn't find anything else that looked clean and reliable, I finally settled on a polling ajax solution with setInterval(lame).. 

Then finally found this youtube video from this summer - basically Google says, yeah we know it sucks, and a 'fix' is coming soon.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMXe-xK0BWA.   : They're going to release the "channel" API that will take care of real-time connectivity.

What I was really looking for was a tool like http://socket.io/ (for node.js) that looks at the user's browsers and picks the best implementation whether it's web sockets, long polling, flash, whatever.

I hope the channel API is something like this.

In the meantime, Google, excuse my impertinence, and thanks for the free tools.  Cheers -
